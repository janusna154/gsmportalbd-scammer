Title: All Administrators of the GSM Community Are Fraudsters!

Incident Details: Recently, the Telegram user @gsmportalbd actively contacted me, stating that Cellebrite Premium was on a significant discount. I was told that I could purchase the genuine Cellebrite Premium for only $800, which included the software, hardware, and the dongle shown in the above - mentioned picture, and that I could create a Cellebrite Portal account. After making the payment, when I logged into the account, the page was blank. Subsequently, they kept delaying the issue resolution, claiming that Israeli staff were investigating the problem. One day later, they blocked me. This community is quite well - known in the GSM field. Out of trust in them, I chose to believe their claims. However, it turned out that this globally - renowned company was openly engaging in fraud by leveraging its brand reputation. I urge all group members and forensic experts to be vigilant, report this fraud, leave the group, and share your own fraud experiences to prevent more users from being deceived. The foundation of the Internet is trust, not fraud!
